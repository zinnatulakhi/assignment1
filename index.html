            <h2>Save a child’s life today</h2>
            <p><small> Every child deserves the best start in life: a happy home, a safe place to play and access to
                    quality education,
                    medical care and nutrition.<br> However, for the 1 in 5 children worldwide living in extreme
                    poverty, many
                    of these simple necessities and
                    rights are out of reach.<br> Instead, their life is incredibly challenging, with the risk of
                    illiteracy,disease,
                    child labour, lifelong poverty and even death.<br> Donate to orphans and children today and help
                    save lives.</small>
